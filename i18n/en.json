Development Officers, University scholarships, \"Target Ebola\" and \"Olympians for Ukraine\" campaigns, the \"World Olympians Forum\" and the \"Olympians Health Survey.\" None of that existed before.\n\nThe Olympic Games generate lots of money, is it correctly divided?

At the London 2012 Olympic Games, I experienced what it truly means to be an Olympian: belonging to a global family that lifts each of us higher than we could ever rise alone. That moment continues to shape my commitment to serve.\n\nCompeting and working across six continents has shown me that while cultures and circumstances differ, the Olympic spirit unites us. I have listened to NOAs with strong structures and resources, and to others struggling simply to remain active. I have spoken with Olympians eager to mentor youth, support their communities, protect their wellbeing, and build meaningful lives after sport, but who often need clearer pathways and practical support. These voices guide my desire to serve every Olympian and every NOA.\n\nOur focus must now be on delivery. We will hire additional Development Officers to strengthen continental and regional support. We will raise more funding to expand NOA grant programmes so more associations can deliver real impact. We will convene Continental Olympians Forums every year to share knowledge, strengthen networks, and build leadership. We will also advocate for stronger post-Games support for Olympians, including access to health insurance and long-term protection of their rights.\n\nIf entrusted with this responsibility, I will serve with empathy, integrity, and commitment, helping to build a future worthy of the legacy we carry together."

      "manifesto": "As part of a strong leadership team alongside Pernilla Wiberg and Olumide Oyedeji, I am running for Treasurer of the World Olympians Association with a clear mission to safeguard WOA's financial integrity, strengthen its long-term sustainability, and ensure Olympians benefit from transparent, accountable, and impactful resource management.\n\n[My professional background](https://app.box.com/s/5xdpz83s6jj72m7z4ozbp4ts601bsj2a) spans more than 30 years of executive leadership across international business, technology, and nonprofit development. I have managed multimillion-dollar budgets, built successful global organizations, and implemented robust financial systems grounded in responsibility and trust. I will bring these same principles to serve the WOA.\n\nI will prioritize financial transparency and accountability through clear reporting standards, continued independent audits, and open communication so every NOA can clearly understand how WOA resources are utilized. I will also focus on securing sustainable funding and building long-term partnerships that honor Olympic values while ensuring WOA remains financially strong and independent. Collaboration with the IOC is essential for alignment and shared purpose, yet WOA must always preserve its autonomy and its ability to advocate for Olympians with clarity and neutrality.\n\nMy commitment extends to service at the community level, where the heart of the Olympian movement truly lives. I will work to ensure more resources reach grassroots initiatives, supporting education, health, career transition, and youth programs, while giving special attention to smaller NOAs and developing nations to ensure equitable access and meaningful impact.\n\nAs Treasurer, I will serve with integrity, discipline, and unwavering dedication, strengthening the WOA and empowering Olympians for generations to come.",
