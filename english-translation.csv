candidates.pernilla.bioFull,"Pernilla Wiberg is a legend on the slopes and a powerhouse in the boardroom. As a Triple Olympic Medalist with 24 individual World Cup victories, 61 World Cup podiums, and the 1997 Overall World Cup title, she is one of the few skiers in history to win races in all five alpine disciplines—her 1991 World Championship gold was the first for a Scandinavian woman in 33 years.

Beyond competition, she became a renowned TV sports commentator for Sveriges Television (SVT). In governance, she served as an IOC Member for eight years across multiple commissions, chaired the IOC Evaluation Commission for the first Winter Youth Olympic Games, and represented the WOA on the IOC Athletes' Commission from 2020–2025.

As current WOA Vice President, she was instrumental in the historic 50/50 continental gender representation reform of the WOA consitution. A Champions for Peace member and successful entrepreneur, she has business interested in hospitality, such as the Pernilla Wiberg Hotel in Sweden and is CEO of Pernilla Wiberg Sportpromotion. Based in Sweden and Monaco since 1995—strategically positioned near WOA Patron Prince Albert and the IOC in Lausanne. She is married to Bødvar Bjerke from Norway and has two children: Axel (born 2003) and Sofia (born 2007). Pernilla is fluent in Swedish, English, French, German, and Norwegian."
candidates.pernilla.manifesto,"As Olympians, we need the WOA. To connect, support, and empower us, and help us through our life transition, and particularly to advocate for our rights within the Olympic Movement.

We need a strong, independent WOA working hard to meet our needs, to help you grow your NOA, and your community projects.

WOA has done a lot the past 14 years. Gender equality in the continental groupings, creation of OLY and the NOA grants programs. Development Officers, University scholarships, ""Target Ebola"" and ""Olympians for Ukraine"" campaigns, the ""World Olympians Forum"" and the ""Olympians Health Survey."" None of that existed before.

Through my work as WOA Vice President, I have engaged closely with many NOAs around the world and gained a clear understanding of your priorities, successes, and challenges. That experience provides a strong foundation, but I want to deepen that engagement and ensure every NOA and every Olympian has a structured opportunity to shape the next phase of the WOA's work.

The Olympic Games generate lots of money, is it correctly divided? Do Olympians have access to a pension system? Do we have access to a health system or an insurance throughout our lives? Do we have full access to the footage of our performance at the Games?

But I would like to hear from you in a more structured way. My first task, if elected, will be to undertake a full 360 review of our processes, our priorities, and a survey of your wishes and needs.

Together we can make a real impact, by not being afraid of change or tackling the difficult subjects, by listening to each other and working together.

As Olympians we have a power. Let us use it. I am ready to take on the challenge, are you?"

Not only a legendary professional athlete, but also a Career and Motivational Speaker, Sports Administrator, Guidance & Counselor expert, Performance Management specialist, Leadership & Management professional, Psychologist, and well-renowned Philanthropist.

The first African player ever drafted outside America to the NBA (2000), he made history as the only African to compete in ALL major basketball tournaments worldwide—Olympics, World Cup, NBA, EuroLeague, Commonwealth Games, and All Africa Games. His remarkable career spanned over two decades (1996–2016), playing professionally in 18 countries across 4 continents with different cultural backgrounds, giving him a unique understanding of the needs of Olympians on every continent.

As Team Nigeria Captain from 2006–2016, he led Nigeria to their first-ever Gold Medal in Basketball at the 2011 All Africa Games in Mozambique, their first-ever AfroBasket Gold in Tunisia 2015, and their first Olympic appearance at London 2012. His international career includes 9 FIBA Africa Championships, 5 All Africa Games (Gold 2011, Silver 2003, Bronze 1999/2007/2015), and championships in Spain, Italy, Greece, UK, Russia, Germany, Japan, South Korea, China, Jordan, Slovenia, Kuwait, and Puerto Rico. He earned MVP honours in the German, Korean, Chinese, and Nigerian leagues.

Beyond sport, he is Chairman & CEO of Legendary Venture and Lume Global Consultancy, employing over 200 people including 6 Olympians and 20+ former athletes. Now based in Lagos, he serves as Vice President of the Nigeria Olympic Committee, President of the Nigeria Olympians Association, Chairman of the WOA Job Committee, and President of West Africa Basketball.

As President of the Nigeria Olympians Association, he transformed the organization through comprehensive rebranding, secured insurance benefits for Olympians, established the Olympians Village and recreation center with hectares of land, achieved NOA inclusion as a full Executive Committee member of the Nigeria Olympic Committee, and established the Olympians Trust Fund. His leadership philosophy centers on rewarding, supporting, and celebrating Olympians while promoting their inclusion in decision making.

A BAL Ambassador, NBA Africa Ambassador, and Laureus Global Ambassador, his foundation has mentored over 45,000 young people across 30+ cities in 20+ countries since 2000. Through Hoops & Read Basketball Club, he has produced 2 NBA players, 45 college players, and 20+ professionals in Europe, Asia, and South America."
candidates.lumi.manifesto,"I am honored to offer myself as a candidate for Secretary General of the World Olympians Association, guided by gratitude, humility, and a strong sense of purpose. At the London 2012 Olympic Games, I experienced what it truly means to be an Olympian: belonging to a global family that lifts each of us higher than we could ever rise alone. That moment continues to shape my commitment to serve.

Competing and working across six continents has shown me that while cultures and circumstances differ, the Olympic spirit unites us. I have listened to NOAs with strong structures and resources, and to others struggling simply to remain active. I have spoken with Olympians eager to mentor youth, support their communities, protect their wellbeing, and build meaningful lives after sport, but who often need clearer pathways and practical support. These voices guide my desire to serve every Olympian and every NOA.

Our focus must now be on delivery. We will hire additional Development Officers to strengthen continental and regional support. We will raise more funding to expand NOA grant programmes so more associations can deliver real impact. We will convene Continental Olympians Forums every year to share knowledge, strengthen networks, and build leadership. We will also advocate for stronger post-Games support for Olympians, including access to health insurance and long-term protection of their rights.

If entrusted with this responsibility, I will serve with empathy, integrity, and commitment, helping to build a future worthy of the legacy we carry together."

[My professional background](https://app.box.com/s/5xdpz83s6jj72m7z4ozbp4ts601bsj2a) spans more than 30 years of executive leadership across international business, technology, and nonprofit development. I have managed multimillion-dollar budgets, built successful global organizations, and implemented robust financial systems grounded in responsibility and trust. I will bring these same principles to serve the WOA.

I will prioritize financial transparency and accountability through clear reporting standards, continued independent audits, and open communication so every NOA can clearly understand how WOA resources are utilized. I will also focus on securing sustainable funding and building long-term partnerships that honor Olympic values while ensuring WOA remains financially strong and independent. Collaboration with the IOC is essential for alignment and shared purpose, yet WOA must always preserve its autonomy and its ability to advocate for Olympians with clarity and neutrality.

My commitment extends to service at the community level, where the heart of the Olympian movement truly lives. I will work to ensure more resources reach grassroots initiatives, supporting education, health, career transition, and youth programs, while giving special attention to smaller NOAs and developing nations to ensure equitable access and meaningful impact.

As Treasurer, I will serve with integrity, discipline, and unwavering dedication, strengthening the WOA and empowering Olympians for generations to come."
candidates.thomas.bioFull,"Thomas Tang combines Olympic grit with Silicon Valley innovation. A two-time Winter Olympian for Chinese Taipei who competed at World Championships and World Cups, he now serves as Chef de Mission for Guinea-Bissau at the 2026 Milano-Cortina Olympics and Secretary General of their Winter Sports Federation—driving the introduction of winter sports in a tropical nation, securing FIS membership, and establishing athlete development programs. His Olympic legacy is a family affair—his daughter competed at Figure Skating at an international level, and his sons have qualified for the 2022 and 2026 Olympics in Alpine Skiing.

Thomas founded Apantac in his basement during the 2008 financial crisis and built it into a global broadcast, ProAV, and openGear technology leader—winning multiple ""Best of Show"" awards including the prestigious NAB PICK HIT AWARD in 2009, and now shipping 200+ products to 40+ countries, from Greenland to New Zealand. His technology has powered Olympic broadcasts, Soccer World Cups, major professional sports leagues, and national broadcasters worldwide, and is used daily by leading social media for their event spaces.

His 30+ year career spans executive leadership across international business, technology, and nonprofit development. Prior to founding Apantac, he served as Vice President at Avitech International (2004–2008) leading global sales and product expansion in broadcast and multiviewer technologies, Director of Marketing at Philips Electronics Broadcast Division (1999–2004) directing strategy across North America and Asia-Pacific with $50M P&L responsibility, Asia Pacific Area Director at Vizrt (1997–1999) expanding market presence for broadcast graphics and real-time visualization systems, and Regional Sales Manager at Evans & Sutherland (1989–1997) where he started as a Senior Software Engineer working on F-14/F-16 flight simulators and NASA Space Shuttle training systems before advancing to regional sales.

Thomas holds patents and published works including Laser Spectroscopy (SPIE, 1987), Physical Camera Calibration with Virtual Backgrounds (1996), Dynamic Shadows in Virtual Studio Production (1997), Cascading Multiviewer Outputs via SATA (2009), Mechanical Magnetic Mounting for AV Equipment (2014), and Intelligent EDID-Based DA Output Management (2018).
